<p align="center">
During my hands-on exploration of robotics and prototyping, I designed and 3D printed multiple drone and rover components using a Flashforge 3D printer. I primarily used PLA and HDPE filaments, carefully designing the parts in AutoCAD and Google SketchUp to achieve a perfect balance between durability and weight. These projects represent my passion for hardware innovation and functional design applied in real-world robotics.

<p align="center">
This 3D printed rover is inspired by India‚Äôs Chandrayaan mission and designed to resemble the Pragyan rover. It features a fully custom-built body that‚Äôs both sturdy and modular, making it easy to upgrade or modify. The rover runs on four geared motors, allowing it to make smooth circular turns and navigate different surfaces with ease. A camera mounted on the front captures images, which are processed using MATLAB to analyze terrain and surroundings. The entire system was coded to simulate real-world exploration tasks, making it a great hands-on project for learning robotics, image processing, and autonomous navigation.

<p align="center">
To protect the drone's propellers during sudden crashes and collisions with unpredictable surfaces, I designed and printed custom propeller guards using AutoCAD. These guards are lightweight yet highly durable, allowing the drone to withstand minor impacts without damaging the blades. The design balances aerodynamic efficiency with robust protection, ensuring optimal flight performance while racing or testing in rugged environments. This upgrade significantly increases the drone‚Äôs resilience, making it ideal for aggressive maneuvering and training scenarios.

<p align="center">
To build drones with better flight efficiency on limited power, I designed and printed these mini and micro drone bodies using PLA material. The designs were optimized in AutoCAD to strike the right balance between structural strength and weight reduction, critical for drones with low payload capacity. Every frame was carefully structured to be as minimal as possible without compromising durability, ensuring the drones could carry small batteries while maximizing airtime. These bodies are ideal for indoor drone development, obstacle-course training, and lightweight surveillance experimentation.
